# PIBIC-WavePropagation-ProfDiego2024-202x
 PIBIC Scholarship Project, supervision of Diego Nunes Brand√£o, focused on applying Computational Methods for Marine Petroleum Exploration. This research aims to develop effective wave propagation model exploring algorithmic optimization techniques and it's mathematical structures. Results from the project will be used for data analysis and interpretation of marine environments.
